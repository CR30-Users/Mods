CR-30 3D Print Mill MGN12 Linear Rail Mod
=========================================

This is a fully printable linear rail upgrade for the CR-30.

Print the parts, use the template to drill 3.5mm holes into your X carriage (it will still be usable without rails, even with the holes).

Remove the v-wheel carriages from the X and Y. Using roll-in M3 nuts, mount the linear rails to the tops of the Y extrusions, and then the front of the X rail. The X carriage plate then screws directly to the X rail's carriage. The belts now point forward through the back of the plate instead of front to back.

A printed shim may be added later to align the belts more straight, but they seem to be fine slightly offset here.
